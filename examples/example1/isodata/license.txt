Notification: terms of use of the Software and the Works Contained therein

Hereby ALT Linux informs the owner (you) of the present copy of
the ALT Linux 4.0 Server distribution (hereafter referred to as "the
Distribution") about the following terms of use of the Software included
in the Distribution:

1. Copyright in the Works

Computer programs and other works included in the Distribution (hereafter
referred to as "the Works") are protected by copyright according to the
Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
other international treaties and national legislation of the country
where the Distribution has been purchased.

A holder of the copyright in a particular Works is indicated in a Work
concerned or in the documentation supplied with it.

2. Fair use of the Works

You can, without any further authorization by a copyright holder,
use the Works in a limited number of ways as it is permitted under
the Berne Convention or the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
other international treaties in the field and national legislation of the
country where the Distribution has been purchased (right of a fair use).

3. The use of Free Works

All the Works in the Distribution, except for the Works listed below,
are licensed to you under so called 'free licenses' and, therefore, are
Free Works. Under a free license, you are granted the following rights
in addition to the usual right of fair use:

- to obtain and to study the source code of a Work;
- to install, copy and use a Work on an unlimited number of computers
for any purpose;
- to make any modifications to a Work;
- to launch, lease, and distribute a Work by any means either in the
original or a modified form, either gratis or for a fee, provided
that you accompany them with a copy of the original license agreement
(free license).

By performing one of the acts of use allowed under a free licence,
when this use would otherwise exceed the scope of a fair use of a Work,
you agree to the terms of that license.

Upon request from you, or any third party interested, made within three
years from the day of publication of this Distribution, ALT Linux will
give the source code of a Work for the cost of physically performing
source distribution.

4. Other Rights

Any rights which have not been explicitly granted to you under a license
agreement or according to applicable laws, or which can not be alienated
from their owner under the laws of the country where the Distribution
has been purchased, are retained by their owners.

5. Rights in texts, designs and trademarks

All texts, designs, and trademarks which are incorporated in the
Distribution or imprinted on the box and the cover of the Distribution
and which constitute an intellectual property of ALT Linux are subject
to copyright, trademark and design protection according to international
treaties and legislation of the country where the Distribution has been
purchased. Their use requires an authorization by ALT Linux.

6. Limited warranty

- Should your copy of the Distribution contain manufacturing defects
ALT Linux will change it without any charge.
- ALT Linux hopes that the Distribution will be useful for you, but in
no circumstances will be liable for any special, incidental, direct or
indirect damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for
loss of business, interruption of business, financial loss, legal fees and
penalties resulting from a court judgement, or any other consequential
loss) arising out of the use or inability to use the Distribution or
any of the Works contained therein.
- Users are responsible for abidance by national Laws while using the
Distribution.
- ALT Linux takes no obligations to provide a users support, unless it
is subject of a special agreement.
